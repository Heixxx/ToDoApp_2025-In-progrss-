## Description  
The project is built using **React** and **.NET**. Key features include:  
- **Modular Components**: Reusable "building blocks" (components) for consistent UI.  
- **API Separation**: Backend API is decoupled from the frontend for scalability.  
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Designed for easy expansion and feature additions.  
---

## Future Plans
Planned enhancements to boost productivity and user engagement:  
- **Strike-Through Effect**: Visual feedback for completed tasks.  
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Track task completion rates and trends.  
- **Advanced Filtering**: Sort tasks by date, priority, or status.  
- **Motivational Features**: Badges, streaks, or rewards to encourage consistent progress.

## Known Issues
**Lesson Learned**:  
- **Lack of Mockups**: Starting development without a design blueprint led to inefficiencies. Always plan with wireframes/mockups first!
